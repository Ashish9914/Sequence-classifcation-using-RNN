# Sequence-classifcation-using-RNN

Sequence classification is a predictive modeling problem where you have some sequence of inputs over space or time and the task is to predict a category for the sequence.

What makes this problem difficult is that the sequences can vary in length, be comprised of a very large vocabulary of input symbols and may require the model to learn 
the long-term context or dependencies between symbols in the input sequence.

In this notebbok i am also training the the network using the combined form of LSTM's and CONV1D to learn the one dimensional spatial features 
od the dataset
